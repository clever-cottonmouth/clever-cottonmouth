💚💚Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of 7000 bucks of old pc, with the Turbo C loaded in, making it print "Hello, Miraj" for the first time. As I went through the C language tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Through middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to a simple First Person engine, with dozens of projects in between. I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.🔴

☮☮ This passion carried me through my education at VTU. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a Kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
